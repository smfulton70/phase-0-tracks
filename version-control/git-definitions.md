# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? It is a way of keeping track of all the changes made to files(s) by various people. It is useful to ensure that all changes made by various people are accurately integrated into the master version
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a copy of the master version, and you use it to do your own work, which you will then merge into the master version.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is when the change that you make to file(s) is recorded within your local repository. A good commit message should be specific about what change was made to the file.
* What is a merge conflict? It is when you have checked out a branch from the master version, and by the time you have done your work and are ready to merge it back into the master version, someone else has already made changes to that master version with the work they submitted from their own branch.
