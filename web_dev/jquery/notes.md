RELEASE 0:

My plan to learn Jquery:

-First of all, I have a Missing Manual book called JavaScript & Jquery that I bought a few
 years back, but never really dove into it. I will keep it by my side and may reference it.

 -I will find the official site for Jquery and will bookmark it.

 -I will do a Google search on Jquery tutorials and will look for the most beginner-friendly tutorial that
  really walks me through it. I will definitely check out Codeacademy (which I LOVED for Ruby), but I will not
  use this site exclusively.

 -I will check out what w3schools.com has in the way of Jquery instruction.

 -I will ensure that I "do the thing" frequently enough that I'm never going more than about 10-12 minutes at a time reading something. Always intersperse the reading with doing, otherwise I fool myself into thinking that I would
 be able to remember what I read.

 -As I approach the two-hour mark, I will see if there are any online tests that I can take that will assess my knowledge to see if I'm on track.

 RELEASE 1:

 -Well, my first plan of attack was starting the Codeacademy.com course in jQuery. It claimed that the course was about 3 hours long. Well, I spent a good hour on the class on Codeacademy.com, even though it was recommended that we not use it exclusively. It really tested me to get the syntax correct on typing the

 $(document).ready(function(){

 });

 correctly. It constantly gave me feedback (purposely vague) on what I did incorrect, and so I was forced to look at my code very carefully to see where I made errors.

 -After an hour on codeacademy.com, I decided to take a look at what w3schools.com had in the way of a jQuery tutorial. I spent a good 40 minutes on that site, working through the tutorials that covered: Intro, Get Started, Syntax, Selectors, and Events. I think that was also time well-spent. I then went to Google and started googling jQuery tutorials, and found a really good PDF on tutorialspoint.com that is pretty much a book on jQuery. I took a scan through it and felt that it was definitely good enough for our purposes. I went through and made other bookmarks on other resources that are jQuery-related.
