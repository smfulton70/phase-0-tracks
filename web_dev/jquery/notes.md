RELEASE 0:

My plan to learn Jquery:

-First of all, I have a Missing Manual book called JavaScript & Jquery that I bought a few
 years back, but never really dove into it. I will keep it by my side and may reference it.

 -I will find the official site for Jquery and will bookmark it.

 -I will do a Google search on Jquery tutorials and will look for the most beginner-friendly tutorial that
  really walks me through it. I will definitely check out Codeacademy (which I LOVED for Ruby), but I will not
  use this site exclusively.

 -I will check out what w3schools.com has in the way of Jquery instruction.

 -I will ensure that I "do the thing" frequently enough that I'm never going more than about 10-12 minutes at a time reading something. Always intersperse the reading with doing, otherwise I fool myself into thinking that I would
 be able to remember what I read.

 -As I approach the two-hour mark, I will see if there are any online tests that I can take that will assess my knowledge to see if I'm on track.
