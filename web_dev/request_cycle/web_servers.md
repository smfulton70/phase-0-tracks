Release 1: Research Web Servers

Find the Thing

2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

It is distributed under an open source license, and it is free.
You can run the program for any purpose, and you are able to study how the program works and
you can change it however you see fit and distribute the modified program to other users. I learned that there are
nine major tenets to the Linux philosophy. They are:

1. Small is beautiful.
2. Each Program Does One Thing Well
3. Prototype as Soon as Possible
4. Choose Portability Over Efficiency
5. Store Data in Flat Text Files
6. Use Software Leverage
7. Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
8. Avoid Captive User Interfaces
9. Make Every Program a Filter

Software leverage basically means that the fewer lines of code you can write to do something, the better. If you are able to use code that has already been written once, there is no point in writing it again. This is consistent
with the DRY philosophy.

3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual private server is a certain amount of memory in the large server that is partitioned off to be allocated to a user who wants to purchase or "rent" that chunk of memory to be used as a server. It might not be a server in its own right, but it is effectively a server. The advantage to using a virtual private server is that you are not paying for all the hardware required for a physical server. Instead, you are basically sharing the hardware with many other people and therefore the cost that you pay is much smaller.

Release 2: Explore the DOM

Find the Thing

A few of the properties that we can make changes to, on the lizard page, are the following:

- Change the list-style-type to "circle" (the default is "disc")
- Change the offsetLeft of the UL
- Change the innerHTML of the button elements
- Swap the positions of the <em></em> and <strong></strong> tags. <em></em> will now have a nextElementSibling value of null.
- On either of the buttons, change the innerHTML value to something like: "See it<br />blend in!""
