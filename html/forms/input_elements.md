Type: Text. This allows you to input any string.
Type: Email. This allows you to input a password, and I suspect it checks for a valid email format.
Type: Password. This allows you to create a password, and it probably has complexity requirements. It masks the characters.
Type: Submit. This is what invokes the validation, and if it passes validation, the form is submitted. Otherwise, it will display errors and make you correct them.
Type: Labels. These simply tell you the name of the field that you are inputting.
Type: Divs (in a fieldset). These create sections in your form.
Type: Select. This allows you to choose from a dropdown a value from a limited number of values.
Type: Checkbox. This is a binary attribute that is either yes (checked) or no (not checked).
Type: Date. This allows you to input a valid date following this format of mm/dd/yyyy.
