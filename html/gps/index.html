      <p><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong></p>

	  <p>The HTML5 semantic tags don't really do anything as far as rendering is concerned, however, they allow content to be more easily shared across various applications. They also provide rich information for robots, page readers, and search engines. I think that the section and article tags might be the most useful, because you can more easily categorize the content within your page with them.</p> 

	  <p><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong></p>

	  <p>The browser uses the order that elements are written within the HTML body to determine the order in which they display on the page. It is also possible to use CSS to modify the display properties on some of the elements, such that they may span across the page instead of downward.</p>

	  <p><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong></p>

	  <p>I learned quite a bit about the snippet feature in Sublime. I will definitely use it to avoid having to recreate structured code every time that I create a new document, assuming that the structure will remain the same very time.</p>

	  <p><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</strong></p>

	  <p>I think that the most challenging concept is finding out exactly how the semantic features of the new HTML5 tags will be used when I create HTML documents. For example, how will my using address tags be different than simply enclosing an address in div tags? From what I understand as it was explained to me, these features help blind people in having web pages read to them by screen readers.</p>
