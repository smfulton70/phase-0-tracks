<p>This is a little paragraph about my cats that I owned when I was a kid. I had two female cats named <strong>Snowflake</strong> and <strong>Tigger</strong>. Snowflake was all <em>white</em> and Tigger was <em>tiger-striped</em>.</p>

<h2>Here are my three favorite patterns for cats in descending order</h2>
<ol>
<li>Solid color</li>
<li>Striped</li>
<li>Calico</li>
</ol>

<h2>Here are my favorite attributes about cats, in no particular order</h2>
<ul>
<li>They bury their poop</li>
<li>They don't bark</li>
<li>They are low-maintenance</li>
</ul>

Here is some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats">more information</a> about cats.
